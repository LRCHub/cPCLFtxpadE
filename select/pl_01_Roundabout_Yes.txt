I'll be the round about
the words will make you
out 'n' out
you change the day your way
call it morning driving thru the
sound and
in and out the valley
the music dance and sing
they make the children
really ring
I spend the day your way
call it moming driving thru the
sound and
in and out the valley
in and around the lake
mountains come out of the sky
and they stand there
one mile over we'll be there and
we'll see you
ten true summers
we'll be there and
laughing too
twenty four before my love
you'll see I'll be
there with you
I will remember you
Your silhouette will
charge the view
of distance atmosphere
call it morning driving thru the
sound and
even in the valley
in and around the lake
mountains come out of the sky
and they stand there
one mile over we'll be there and
we'll see you
ten true summers
we'll be there and
laughing too
twenty four before my love
you'll see I'll be
there with you
along the drifting cloud the
eagle searching
down on the land
catching the swirling wind the
sailor sees
the rim of the land
the eagles dancing wings create
as weather
spins out of hand
go closer hold the land feel
partly no more
than grains of sand
westand to lose all time a
thousand answers
by in our hand
next to your deeper fears
we stand
surrounded by a million years
I'll be the round about
the words will make you
out 'n' out
I'll be the round about
the words will make you
out 'n' out
in and around the lake
mountains come out of the sky
and they stand there
twenty four before my love
I'll be there
I'll be the round about
the words will make you
out 'n' out
I spend the day your way
call it moming driving thru the
sound and
in and out the valley
in and around the lake
mountains come out of the sky
and they stand there
one mile over we'll be there and
we'll see you
ten true summers
we'll be there and
laughing too
twenty four before my love
you'll see I'll be
there with you
